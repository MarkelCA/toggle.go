# api
This is a REST API implementation using the [gin](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin) HTTP framework. It uses [JWT](https://jwt.io/) and an additional api key to manage the authentication. Also the passwords are hashed and the requests are encrypted using TLS (with self-signed certificates for testing purposes).
